# Mission-to-Mars
Web-scraping project on Mars

## Overview of the analysis:
This project is a demonstration of using Python, Splinter, Flask, Mongo, and Beautiful Soup; to create a webpage that stores all of the collected scraped data from multiple sites. The button on the front page uses BeautifulSoup and Splinter to scrape full-resolution images of Marsâ€™s hemispheres and the titles of those images, stores the scraped data on a Mongo database, uses a web application to display the data, and alters the design of the web app to accommodate all of the data we have scraped.

## Results:
- Scrape Full-Resolution Mars Hemisphere Images and Titles
- Update the Web App with Mars Hemisphere Images and Titles
- Add Bootstrap 3 components to change the design

- Here we see the front page of the web app which shows the design elements added

- Here we see the images that have been scraped to be displayed in the Flask app


## Summary:
In the app.py, we set up the flask, mongo, and app routes to scrape the images and titles. First off the websraping file scraping.py is called to scrape all of the images and add them to a dictionary. Once the images and titles have been stored, we can upload them to the Flask app to be displayed via index.html. In the final part of the project, I decided to modify the color scheme of some of the elements of the page to match the scraped images.
